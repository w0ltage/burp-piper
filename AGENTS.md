This is a burp suite extension named "Piper" and written in Kotlin.

Piper integrates external tools and their pipelines to Burp Suite. The extension can pass HTTP requests and responses from Burp to external programs, then feed the execution result back to Burp. With Piper you can create:

- Commentators: Display the output of an external program in Proxy History as comments. For example, you can display the cryptographic hash of every request by piping their content to sha256sum.
- Highlighters: Highlight items in the proxy history based on their contents. For example, you can highlight items where HTTP response includes elements of a wordlist.
- Message Viewers: Display the contents of HTTP messages with custom formatting. For example, you can display Protobuf structures by piping message contents to protoc.
- Context Menu Items: Invoke external tools from context menu. For example, you can use an external diff GUI to compare HTTP messages.
- Intruder Payload Generators: Generate payloads for Intruder with external tools. For example, you can make Intruder use password candidates generated by John the Ripper.
- Intruder Payload Processors: Transform Intruder payloads. For example, you can apply base64 encoding with a custom alphabet using an external script.
- Macros: You can use external tools as part of Macros. For example, you can automatically generate predictable CSRF tokens for every outgoing request.
- HTTP Listeners: Transform outgoing and incoming HTTP messages. For example, you can use an external Python script to handle custom encryption.

Currently it mostly uses the deprecated burp extender api instead of modern burp suite montoya api. If something needed to be rewritten, consider using the montoya api.

Burp Suite Montoya API documentation is available via this Context7 API (it uses embeddings to retrieve information). To use it you need to send a request to URL like this: https://context7.com/api/v1/portswigger/burp-extensions-montoya-api?type=json&tokens=100000&topic=<TOPIC>

For example, you want to learn more on "http requests" in montoya api. To get relevant information all you need to do is to put keywords in parameter "topic", so it would become like this:
https://context7.com/api/v1/portswigger/burp-extensions-montoya-api?type=json&tokens=100000&topic=http%20requests
